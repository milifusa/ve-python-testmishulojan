# Valid Eval Python Test

The `main.py` file contains the challenge description along with test cases to verify the correctness of your solution. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `main.py` file to implement your solution to the challenge.
2. After making changes, press `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` to save the file.
3. Saving the file will prompt you to log in to the sandbox environment.
4. Log in using your credentials to run the code and execute the tests.

Ensure that all the test cases pass to confirm the correctness of your implementation.

Note: The `main.py` file uses the Valid Eval feature, which allows executing code securely within the sandbox environment. Make sure to save the file and log in to the sandbox when prompted to run your code successfully.

Best of luck with the challenge! Remember to test your solution thoroughly and ensure it meets all the requirements.
